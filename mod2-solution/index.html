			<div class="region blue"><p class="bold", id="title">Bratwurst</p></div>
			<p id="text">Bratwurst is a type of German sausage made from veal, beef, or pork. The name is derived from the Old High German Bratwurst, from <span class="it">brat-</span>, finely chopped meat, and Wurst, sausage, although in modern German it is often associated with the verb <span class="it">braten</span>, to pan fry or roast. Beef and veal are usually incorporated amongst a blend often including pork.</p>

			<div class="region red"><p class="bold", id="title">Bobotie</p></div>
			<p id="text">Bobotie is a well-known South African dish consisting of spiced minced meat baked with an egg-based topping. Bobotie appears to be a variant of Patinam ex lacte, layers of cooked meat, pine nuts, and seasoned with pepper, celery seeds and asafoetida. These were cooked until the flavours had blended, when a top layer of egg and milk was added.</p>
